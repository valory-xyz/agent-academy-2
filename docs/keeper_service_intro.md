## Introduction

This keeper network is built using the [open-aea](https://valory-xyz.github.io/open-aea/) 
and [open-autonomy](https://docs.autonolas.network) frameworks.
We suggest new developers to read this documentation to get started.


## What is the keeper network?

The Keeper network is a decentralized DevOps platform where job posters and those willing to perform these jobs can 
exchange goods for services. 
Keepers are agents that execute the tasks required to complete specific types of job.


## Why use a Keepers network?

Providing an end-to-end guarantee on how the application functions requires computation that smart contracts cannot do but that must be decentralized and highly reliable.

Q: Why does trust minimized off-chain computation matter?
A: The system and services need to be reliable under all circumstances. That is to say, regardless of network congestion and gas prices, regardless of server failures and regardless of adverserial DDOS attacks or malicious actors attempting to exploit the system in any way.

Reasons: 
- automation
- smart contract cannot do it
- too expensive to do on-chain
- privacy reasons

Examples:
monitoring, limit order execution, staking and fee distributions, yield farming, smart contract DevOps requests, liquidations, dynamic NFTs

## How does the Keeper network function?

It can execute, at minimal cost, code that was deployed on-chain and whose computation can therefor be verified by anyone. A keeper network is contract specific; it is committed to only compute code for a specific contract which provides cryptographic assurances and transparency
