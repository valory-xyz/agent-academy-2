![KeeperKit](images/keeperkit.svg){ align=left }
The KeeperKit is a toolkit to build agent services that can perform the execution of smart contract functionalities in a reliable, trustless and cost-efficient way. The keeper system runs on off-chain infrastructure, which enables almost arbitrarily complex computation that is unrestricted by storage space of the blockchain and neither prohibited by expensive on-chain transaction fees.
This enables its users, be it an individual developer, another application or a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), to perform DevOps jobs in a permissionless, secure and fully-automated manner.
