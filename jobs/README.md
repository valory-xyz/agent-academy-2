# veOLAS Job

This project contains a job contract for veOLAS.
There is a function in veOLAS called `checkpoint()` that needs to be called “periodically”. 
This is quite fitting to what keep3r jobs are meant for, as such we think that it makes sense 
to have this problem solved by having a keep3r job, that will be worked only by our keep3r service.
